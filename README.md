# Tech Pool
A platform that connects between drivers and hitchhikers who study at the Technion in an easy and convenient way for collaborative rides.

## Motivation
For many students who study at the Technion, getting and providing lifts is not an easy task. They need to synchronize with apps like facebook and whatsapp which were’t designed for this purpose and don’t answer their specific needs, such as the need to know that the driver is from the technion. We want to give the students an app for an easier and faster way to get and provide lifts which answer their needs and preferences. 

## Core Features
1. Only Technion students can log in to the app.
2. Searching lifts by starting point, destination, time, distance, price, preferences and sorting them by date or distance.
3. Setting drives by starting point, destination, time, distance, price, preferences and receiving requests from hitchhiker on them.
4. manage and view my scheduled drives and lifts.

## Complementary features
1. User profiles with their details and preferences which users can see on providing,requesting or searhcing a lift.
2. Chat between drivers and hitchhikers.
3. Getting notifications on available lifts which meets my desired lift preference.
4. Using my current location to get or set drives and lifts.
5. Saving favorite locations and using them in getting or setting drives and lifts.
6. Getting notifications from the app to my phone.
